These are my personal notes for books, articles, and papers that I have been reading. Why am I doing this ?
Well for 2 reasons. First, writing notes is how I learn. Not only does it help me slow down my thoughts and focus on the content, it also serves as a place to pick up from the previous reading sessions. Second, when I am writing these notes I try imagine using them to explain the main concepts to a curious audience.
